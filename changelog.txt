Version 1.2 - Balancing and Pausing
	New Features:
		The game can now be paused using the escape key, and automatically pauses if the game window loses focus.

	Changes:
		Shortened the death screen significantly, and changed the sound that plays to hopefully be less annoying.
		Increased the time you can be over the ambient volume before dying from .1 seconds to .15 seconds.
		Reworked the end of level 4.
		Increased the ambient volume of level 4 phase 1, to make it a little easier.
		Changed the art for levels 2, 3, and 4 to add visual clarity.

	Fixes:
		Holding the jump key no longer makes the player continuously jump. The key must be released before another jump can be performed.
		Either shift key can now be used to perform a dash.

Version 1.1 - Small Fixes
	Changed the sounds that play while carrying an orb to be much less jarring.
	Tweaked level 4's music so it's more obvious when it's safe to jump.
